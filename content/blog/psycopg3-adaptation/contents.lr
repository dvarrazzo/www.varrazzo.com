One of the main behavioural differences between psycopg2 and 3, and a big
enought cause of incompatibility to require a "3", is the use of server-side
binding vs. client-side (psycopg2 predates the FE-BE protocol supporting it).
Passing Python objects to the server as separate arguments leads sometimes to
a behaviour of the server different to what people are used to using psql and
psycopg2. An example: what do you think

.. code:: python

    cursor.execute("select %s, %s", ["hello", 10])

should fetch? I assume it would be desirable to have a record ``("hello",
10)`` back - consistently to what you would return if you merged argument
client-side and queried for ``select 'hello', 10``. However keeping this
behaviour predictable proved already tricky. When passing arguments to merge
server-side, the client must pass their string (or binary) representation and,
optionally, the oid of their types. The most intuitive thing to do would be to
associate the text type oid (25) to Python strings. This works well for
queries like the above one, but it proves too strict a type definition in
context where a cast from text is not allowed. For instance this will fail:

.. code:: python

    cursor.execute("create table testjson(data jsonb)")
    cursor.execute("insert into testjson (data) values (%s)", ["{}"])

The latter will raise the same exception you would get in psql if you execute
``insert into testjson (data) values ('{}'::text)``. The reason why a ``values
('{}')`` works as expected in psql is because the untyped literal is
interpreted as unknown, and the server can always cast from unknown to any
other type. If we wanted to insert the data above the query should be
rewritten as:

.. code:: python

    cursor.execute("insert into testjson (data) values (%s::jsonb)", ["{}"])

About a week ago I started the task to write `a Django backend for
psycopg3`__: running its test suite is proving a great way to observe the
behaviour of server-side binding in a plethora of different environments. The
problem of the non-implicit cast from text to jsonb made porting the backend
from psycopg2 to 3 `quite a tricky matter`__.

In order to provide an experience more similar to the use of psql and of
psycopg2, one possibility is to not pass an oid type for the strings, leaving
it unknown. When I tried with that approach, passing strings to jsonb fields
(which is not necessarily what you would do, but it's what Django does,
probably to uniform JSON dumping across different adapter) became immediately
much simpler. So it seems a good choice, but not an overall win: our "hello
world" query:

.. code:: python

    cursor.execute("select %s, %s", ["hello", 10])

fails with PostgreSQL 9.6 and older versions, returning an error such as
*could not determine data type of parameter $1*. PostgreSQL 10 and following
are more permissive and convert unknown to text on output.

It seems like there is a choice to make here: mine at the moment is to keep
the latter behaviour, both because that's what allows to write the simpler
code with the majority of the supported PostgreSQL versions. People using 9.6
and previous version would need to adjust to:

.. code:: python

    cursor.execute("select %s::text, %s", ["hello", 10])

but the use case of inserting data into tables seems a more important use case
than parroting back a string after a database round-trip.

.. admonition:: Choices to cast Python ``str`` type:

    To ``unknown``:

    * pro: passed without casting to most data types and functions
    * con: requires a cast to roundtrip back with PostgreSQL 9.6 and previous

    To ``text``:

    * pro: roundtrips with PostgreSQL 9.6 and previous
    * con: may require several casts for most of data type, both in insert and
      functions

    ``unknown`` seems the winner.

What about the numbers? That's a problem thorny in a different way. Python
integers are of arbitrary size, so they map better to a subset of the
``numeric`` type than to ``int4`` or ``int8``. However there is a similar
problem, where seemingly familiar expression don't behave as expected. If this
works in psql::

    select data -> 'a' -> 2 from testjson;

a similar statement with 2 as a parameter will fail with an error like
*operator does not exist: jsonb -> numeric*. Passing unknown as oid would
work, but now our greeting would return instead ``('hello', '10')``, with the
number converted to string. This is probably too much of a departure from the
expected behaviour; at least, unlike the test-to-json case, there is an
automatic cast from ``numeric`` to integer, so an ``insert into
integer_field`` works as expected. Only operators and functions whose
arguments are declared ``integer`` and there is no ``numeric`` version trip
into an error: JSON's ``->``, binary operators such as ``>>`` and ``&``, and
few others::

    piro=# select current_date, current_date + 1;
     current_date |  ?column?
    --------------+------------
     2020-11-07   | 2020-11-08
    (1 row)

    piro=# select current_date + 1::numeric;
    ERROR:  operator does not exist: date + numeric
    LINE 1: select current_date + 1::numeric;
                                ^
    HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might
    need to add explicit type casts.

Note that when Postgres says ``integer`` it means 4 bytes signed: defaulting
the Python ``int`` to the ``bigint`` oid solves no problem - the same
functions would fail the same way, and defaulting it to ``int4`` I feel it
would overflow too easily in a 64 bits world.

How to fix that, if you are an end user? As the hint suggests, the user would
have to either add a cast to the query, which would look like:

.. code:: python

    cur.execute("select current_date + %s::int", [offset])

or to specify an object that would get converted in Postgres to the oid of
``integer``: in psycopg3 I'm testing with adding subclasses of ``int`` called
``Int4``, ``Int8`` etc. to map more closely on the Postgres types:

.. code:: python

    cur.execute("select current_date + %s", [Int4(offset)])


.. role:: strike
    :class: strike

.. admonition:: Choices to cast Python ``int`` type:

    To ``unknown``:

    * +1: can express the full range of the unbounded Python ``int``
    * +2: can be passed without cast to most data types and functions
    * -2: it round-trips back to string, error on PostgreSQL < 10

    To ``numeric``:

    * +1: can express the full range of the unbounded Python ``int``
    * +1: can be passed without cast to most data types
    * -1: requires a cast for some functions
    * :strike:`-1: it round-trips to 'Decimal'`
    * +0.5: **it can round-trip back to int**, with additional care - more to
      follow

    To ``int8``:

    * -0.5: can't express values not fitting in 64 bits (relatively limited
      use case: if the target column is ``numeric`` then it would be wise for
      the user to pass a ``Decimal``)
    * +1: can be passed without cast to most data types
    * -1: requires a cast for some functions
    * +1: it round-trips back to ``int``

    To ``int4``:

    * -1: limited range: couldn't be used to pass a value not fitting into 32
      bytes from Python to a ``bigint``.
    * +2: can be passed without cast to most data types and functions
    * +1: it round-trips back to ``int``

    Winner: probably ``numeric``, with ``int8`` runner-up?

What about the observation on ``numeric``? If we dump ``int`` -> ``numeric``
to the db, and load back ``numeric`` -> ``Decimal`` from it, we end up with
integers round-tripping to ``Decimal``, which could easily create errors in
Python contexts which are not ready to deal with fixed-point arithmetic.
However, upon receiving a ``numeric`` from the database, we can check what
number it is: if it has no decimal digit it can be returned to Python as
``int``, if it has any decimal digit it must be returned as ``Decimal``.

This mechanism can be as trivial as `looking if there is a '.'`__ in the data
returned by the database; however in many cases the is job made simpler (or at
least more efficient) by the presence of the ``numeric`` modifiers:
``numeric`` comes in three flavours:

- ``numeric``: arbitrary precision (number of digits) and scale (number of
  digits after the decimal point),

- ``numeric(``\ *n*\ ``)``: limited precision, no digit after the decimal
  point (equivalent to ``numeric(``\ *n*\ ``, 0)``),

- ``numeric(``\ *n*\ ``,`` *m*\ ``)``: limited precision, fixed number of
  digits after the decimal point.

.. __: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg3/commit/5ced659f4838cf72c1981518ae2804942ebbd07b

The modifier information is returned in many contexts (among which the most
important: selecting data from tables): if we know the scale `we can decide
upfront`__ to load the entire column as ``int`` if the scale is 0, ``Decimal``
otherwise. If the modifier is unknown we can look at the presence of the dot.

.. __: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg3/commit/2553e83c5899855fa178860aa3b6b3dab0d4d6b4

Returning an ``int`` in a context where ``Decimal`` are expected doesn't seem
a big problem: throwing an integer to a fixed-point calculation doesn't wreak
havoc has it does throwing a ``Decimal`` in a context of ``flaot``
calculations. Running the entire Django test suite after this change caused no
test to fail, which gives me some comfort.

----

Being the adaptation system flexible, users are able to override these
choices, but I don't expect many people wanting to do it, and doing it
process-wise might cause interoperation problems across libraries. The
behaviour out-of-the-box is obviously important and I would like to get the
trade-offs right.

What do you think?

    This article was modified after experimenting with the ``numeric`` to
    ``int`` strategy. Thank you for rubber-ducking. 🦆

.. admonition:: Note

    This article was written with the Psycopg 2 model in mind, where there is
    a direct mapping from the parameter type to the adaptation function.

    After further expermentation with Psycopg 3, this model proved
    inadequately rigid. Psycopg 3 has improved since: at the time of the `beta
    1 release
    <https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2021/08/30/psycopg-30-beta1-released/>`__,
    it implements an adaptation algorithm which can use the parameter value to
    select the right PostgreSQL type.

    You can find the current state of the affairs in the `Psycopg 3
    documentation <https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/advanced/adapt.html>`__
